# Welcome to My Pet Projects Repository!
This repository contains a collection of my personal projects, created for learning and experimentation purposes. Each project is a standalone entity, with its own unique features, functionalities, and codebase.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and knowledge in various technologies and programming languages. Each project is created with the intention of exploring new ideas, concepts, and tools, and to provide a platform for experimentation.

## Projects
Here's a list of the projects currently available in this repository:

- Customer Churn
- Determination of the value of cars
- Forecasting taxi orders
- Gold Recovery
- Protection of personal data
- Steel melting temperature prediction
- Toxic Comments
- Well location selection
- Parsing Vivino

Each project is contained within its own subdirectory, with its own README.md file describing the project in detail.

## Contributions
I welcome contributions to any of the projects in this repository. If you find a bug, have a suggestion for a new feature, or simply want to improve the codebase, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
