# Customer churn
Customers began to leave X-Bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers figured keeping current customers was cheaper than attracting new ones.

It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank soon or not. You are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.

Build a model with an extremely large *F1*-measure. Check the *F1*-measure on the test set yourself. To pass the project successfully, you must bring the metric to 0.59.

Additionally, measure *AUC-ROC*and compare its value with *F1*-measure.
