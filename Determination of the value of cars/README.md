# Determining the cost of cars

A used car dealership is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. At your disposal are historical data: technical specifications, equipment, and prices of vehicles. We need to build a model to determine the cost.

The customer is important:

- the quality of the prediction;
- prediction speed;
- studying time.
